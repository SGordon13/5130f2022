This subdirectory is meant to hold the progress made for week four on our project.
We made more progress on the student form, specifically checking if the student already has requested an ID.
The app will display the permission number it already assigned to them.
We also added forms for picking a class and providing an email or student ID.

The work that I am submittin is both mine and my group partner, Adam King's work.
