In this paper, I will discuss different cryptographic algorithms, focusing on more popular algorithms such as AES, DES, and RSA. I will be comparing these algorithms, going over their strengths, shortcomings, and use cases. This is an incredibly important subject under the umbrella of Internet and Web Systems because any application that uses the internet must also keep in mind the security of its userâ€™s data. Making sure user data is secure is incredibly important, and in this paper, I will discuss the different options available for network security.
