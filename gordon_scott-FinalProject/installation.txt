This file will serve as the installation guide.

Our app is simply html, javasript, and PHP code files. Because of this,
there is no executable included in our submission. To get started with 
our app, we used XAMPP to host a local server where we would test our
application. If you want to run our app locally, you need XAMPP or a 
similar server hosting software. For our final submission, we also got
our project working on the uml cs servers. both of these methods will
share a similar setup process. 

Using XAMPP, you need to make sure the apache web server is running.
You should place the files from our project in a folder placed
in your subdirectory here: 'Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/'. Once you
have the files in the correct location you must change the permissions
on the data folder to 777 using the command:
'chmod 777 ./data'

Using the cs servers, you should place the files in a folder placed in
your public_html subdirectory. Once you have the files in the correct
location, you have to change the permissions on the entire app folder
for the app to run correctly. You have to change the permission on the
app folder to 777. Once you do that, you can create an account as the
professor, and run the app normally.
