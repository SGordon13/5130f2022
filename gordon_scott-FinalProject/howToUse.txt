This file will serve as the instructions on how to use our app.
The instructions will be split into two parts, the professor and the student.

Professor:
After initial setup of the app, you will be promped to sign up using an email and password.
From there you can enter your account credentials, and do any of the functions that the
app provides. The functions are mostly self explanitory, but you can add classes, 
remove classes, or select a class. When you select a class, you can add permission numbers,
remove permission numbers, or free permission numbers. You can also clear all permission 
for the selected class, or view the permission numbers for the selected class.

Student:
Once the professor sets up classes and permission numbers, students will be able to enter
their first name, last name, student email, and student ID. With the entered information,
students will be able to select a class and get a permission number assigned to them.
Once they are granted a permission number, if they forget it they can enter their ID or 
email, and they will be given the same permission number again.
