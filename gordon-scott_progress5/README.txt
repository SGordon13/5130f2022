This subdirectory is meant to hold the progress made for week five on our project.
We made more progress on the professor's form, specifically allowing the professor to view a table of the permission numbers for a selected class.
The app will read what class is selected, and when the "view permission numbers" button is pressed, it will display the table at the bottom of the page.
We temporarily set aside the backend for the professor for the last step of the project.
We will add the ability for the professor to add permission numbers in multiple ways such as file upload, or text entry.

The work that I am submittin is both mine and my group partner, Adam King's work.
